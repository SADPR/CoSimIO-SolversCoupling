# CoSimIO Solver and Script Coupling

This repository provides examples of coupling different solvers and scripts using CoSimIO, a framework for solver-to-solver communication. It includes installation guides, tutorials, and example cases to help users integrate CoSimIO into their computational workflows for multi-solver simulations.

This repository is based on the official [CoSimIO tutorial](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/CoSimIO/) provided by Kratos Multiphysics. Most of the files differ from the original examples to meet our specific needs, particularly in coupling CoSimIO with another solver. This repository is designed to walk you through the basics, step by step, until you reach the point of coupling two different solvers: Kratos Multiphysics with OpenFOAM. This advanced coupling scenario is not covered in the original repository. For a more detailed exploration of CoSimIO and its capabilities, we encourage you to visit the official documentation and tutorials.
