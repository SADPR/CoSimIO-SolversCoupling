# CoSimIO Solver and Script Coupling

This repository provides examples of coupling different solvers and scripts using CoSimIO, a framework for solver-to-solver communication. It includes installation guides, tutorials, and example cases to help users integrate CoSimIO into their computational workflows for multi-solver simulations.

This repository is based on the official [CoSimIO tutorial](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/CoSimIO/) provided by Kratos Multiphysics. Some files and examples have been adapted to suit specific needs for coupling solvers and data exchange. For a more detailed exploration of CoSimIO and its capabilities, we encourage you to visit the official documentation and tutorials.
